# NFT 2.0 approach

The landscape of NFTs is evolving rapidly. While early iterations of NFTs focused primarily on digital art and collectibles, the future holds much more significant potential. NFTs are reshaping various industries by introducing verifiable ownership, scarcity, and interoperability in digital and physical assets. They are not just about owning a piece of art or a collectible; they represent a paradigm shift in how we perceive ownership and value in the digital age.

## "NFT is a How, not a What"

Think of NFTs as the plastic cards of the digital age. They can be anything: a membership card, a bank account, a coffee shop loyalty card, or your apartment ownership confirmation. It's not about what they are, but how they function. NFTs represent a powerful technology with specific technical features that provide substantial benefits across various industries.

- **On-Chain Data**: Storing critical information directly on the blockchain ensures immutability and transparency. 

  > Imagine having budget expenditure data stored on the blockchain. This ensures that the data is immutable and transparent, making it easier for citizens to verify the proper use of public funds.

- **Unique Metadata**: Each NFT contains unique metadata that provides detailed information about the asset it represents. 

  > Imagine writing a song. The NFT for this song contains the song itself, along with its creation date, your authorship, and other important details. This ensures that no one else can ever claim rights to your work.

- **Immutable Proof of Ownership**: NFTs offer a secure and tamper-proof record of ownership, ensuring that the true owner of a digital or physical asset can always be verified.

  > Imagine owning a car and having the ownership documents stored as an NFT. You no longer need to carry physical papers, as the NFT provides a secure and verifiable proof of ownership that can be easily accessed when needed.

- **Verification of Authenticity**: NFTs enable the verification of an asset’s authenticity, reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting. 

  > Imagine completing an online course and receiving your certificate as an NFT. Employers can instantly verify the authenticity of your certificate. Your competitor with a fake certificate is no longer a threat in the job market.

- **Decentralization**: Operating on decentralized networks reduces reliance on centralized authorities. 

  > Imagine the records of your car ownership being stored on a decentralized network. This ensures that even if the government registry is hacked or fails, the data proving that the car belongs to you remains accessible and secure.

- **Flexibility and Innovation**: The NFT standard is continually evolving, with new use cases and applications emerging regularly. This flexibility allows for constant innovation and adaptation to new technological and market developments.

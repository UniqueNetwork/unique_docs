# Nested NFTs

## Overview

Nested NFTs, also known as Bundled NFTs or NFT Containers, are a unique format that allows one NFT to own other NFTs, forming a parent-child relationship in a tree structure. This nesting mechanism enables the creation of complex hierarchies of digital assets within a single token, turning it into a multi-dimensional, multi-layered entity. Unlike traditional NFTs, which are standalone, Nested NFTs offer enhanced functionality and versatility, making them ideal for various advanced applications.

Although nesting sounds complex, creating a bundle is indeed as simple as making one transfer transaction. Any NFT in our network can be read as an address, allowing it to own other assets, whether they are other NFTs or coins. 

The nesting depth of a bundle is limited to 5 generations (or 5 layers deep). 

## Real Life Example

Imagine you have a bag. Inside this bag, you can put different items: a wallet, books, and gadgets. Inside the wallet, you can have several items such as cards, photos, and money. 

This illustrates how Nested NFTs work. You have a main NFT (the bag) that contains other NFTs (the wallet, books, gadgets), and those NFTs can contain even more NFTs (cards, photos) or coins (money).

## Key Features

### No Smart Contracts Required
Nested NFTs can be created and managed without the need for complex smart contract development. This simplifies the process and reduces potential security risks associated with smart contracts.

### Hierarchical Structures
Nested NFTs allow embedding or linking one NFT within another, creating rich, hierarchical digital asset structures. This feature is particularly useful for applications that require complex asset relationships.

### Simplified Management
By nesting multiple NFTs within a single parent NFT, users can manage numerous assets through a single NFT. This simplifies portfolio and transaction processes, making it easier to handle large collections of digital assets. The process of creating a bundle is as simple as a transfer transaction, making it intuitive and logical, much like putting items into a bag.

## Benefits for Users

### Enhanced Interactivity
Nested NFTs enable unique interactions between nested elements, offering users a rich and engaging experience. This can be particularly valuable in interactive applications such as games and digital storytelling.

### Increased Value
The ability to nest NFTs can create new value dynamics, as certain combinations of nested assets might become highly sought after. This can increase the overall value of digital collections.

### Creative Freedom
Nested NFTs allow for new forms of artistic and creative expression, enabling intricate and multi-layered digital creations. Artists and creators can explore complex compositions and innovative presentations.

## Use Case Examples

### Digital Storytelling
Authors can nest chapters or scenes within a complete book or movie NFT. This structure provides a cohesive and interactive way to present digital stories, allowing for a richer narrative experience.

### Art Installations
Represent physical art installations as a primary NFT, with individual pieces as nested NFTs. This allows for a comprehensive digital representation of complex art projects, enhancing the display and interaction possibilities.

### Gaming
In-game assets such as characters, weapons, and armor can be nested under a primary game character NFT. This simplifies asset management and enhances the gaming experience by creating a unified structure for all in-game items. 

### Fashion and Retail
Brands can create virtual showrooms where customers design their own clothing by selecting styles, colors, and accessories from a brand's digital collection. Each selected item can be a nested NFT within a main wardrobe NFT.

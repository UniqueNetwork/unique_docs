# Dynamic NFTs

> At Unique Network, we see NFTs as metadata containers, not just collectible images. Want to learn more? Check out [Our Approach to NFTs](../approach.md). We bring this vision to life through our features. Explore the full list here: [NFT Features Overview](../token-types/nft.md).

Dynamic NFTs, also known as Live NFTs, are a new and innovative format that allows NFTs to change and evolve over time based on external factors. Unlike static NFTs, which remain unchanged once minted, Dynamic NFTs can alter their metadata in response to various triggers such as user interactions, in-game achievements, or real-time data feeds from external APIs. This dynamic nature transforms NFTs from static collectibles into living digital assets that can offer continuous engagement and interactivity.

## To put it simply

Imagine a game character, represented as an NFT, that can grow both over time and through actions. For example, a magical knight automatically gains experience and levels up every week, but also acquires new abilities and changes appearance after defeating bosses. The character NFT evolves accordingly based on events programmed by the game developers.

## Key Features

- **Interactive and Engaging**:
  Dynamic NFTs can respond to user actions and external events, creating a more engaging and interactive experience for users. This can be particularly valuable in gaming and digital art, where user interactions can drive changes in the NFTs.

- **Real-Time Updates**:
  The metadata of Dynamic NFTs can be updated in real-time based on data from external sources such as APIs. This allows NFTs to reflect real-world events, such as changes in weather, stock prices, or sports scores, providing a richer and more relevant user experience.

- **Programmable Elements**:
  Dynamic NFTs can include programmable elements that react to specific conditions or triggers. These elements can be coded to change the NFT's attributes, unlock new content, or modify its appearance or functionality based on user interactions or external data.

- **Adaptive Design**:
  Dynamic NFTs can be designed to adapt over time, reflecting changes in the environment or user behavior. For example, an NFT artwork could change colors or shapes depending on the time of day or the weather, creating a more immersive and responsive user experience.

## Benefits for Users

- **Continuous Engagement**:
  Dynamic NFTs provide continuous engagement by evolving and changing over time. This keeps users interested and invested in the NFTs, as they can see their assets grow and develop. The constant evolution of Dynamic NFTs creates a sense of ongoing interaction and involvement for the user.

- **Personalized Experiences**:
  Dynamic NFTs can offer personalized experiences by adapting to individual user actions and preferences. This can create a more tailored and unique experience for each user, making their NFTs feel more relevant and personal.

- **Increased Value**:
  The dynamic nature of these NFTs can increase their value, as NFTs that evolve based on user achievements or real-world events may become more desirable and valuable over time. Collectors and investors may find these evolving assets more appealing due to their unique and changing characteristics.

- **Real-Time Interaction**:
  Users can interact with Dynamic NFTs in real-time, seeing immediate changes based on their actions or external inputs. This real-time interaction enhances the user's sense of connection and control over their digital assets.

## Use Case Examples

### üéÆ Gaming: Evolving Characters
Dynamic NFTs can be used in games to create evolving characters, items, and worlds. For example, a character NFT can gain new abilities or change appearance based on the player's actions and achievements in the game. This adds a layer of depth and immersion to the gaming experience.

### üñºÔ∏è Digital Art: Interactive Artwork
Artists can create dynamic digital art that changes over time or in response to viewer interactions. This can include pieces that evolve based on the time of day, weather conditions, or user input, offering a more engaging and interactive artistic experience.

### üß∏ Collectibles: Digital Pets
Dynamic NFTs can be used to create dynamic collectibles that change and grow over time. For example, a digital pet NFT can evolve and gain new features as the owner interacts with it. This ongoing evolution can increase the collectible's appeal and value.

### üíπ Financial Instruments: Real-Time Updates
Dynamic NFTs can represent financial instruments that change value based on market conditions. For example, an NFT representing a stock portfolio can update its value in real-time based on stock prices, providing a transparent and up-to-date representation of the portfolio's value.

### üéµ Music and Entertainment: Interactive Experiences
Dynamic NFTs can be used in music and entertainment to create interactive experiences. For example, a music NFT could change its composition or visuals based on listener interactions or external data, offering a unique and evolving experience for fans.

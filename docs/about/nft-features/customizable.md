# Customizable NFTs

## Overview

Customizable NFTs are designed to allow users to modify and personalize their digital assets. 

Building on the foundation of dynamic and nested NFTs, the concept of customizable NFTs further expands the landscape of digital asset interaction. 

In these cases, the trigger that causes the NFT change is an ‘update of NFTs relationships’ event: creation of the NFT bundle or its recomposition in various ways. Customizable NFTs allow for the crafting of specific collections with predetermined roles and relationships, enabling users to create intricate and interactive digital assets.

## Real Life Example

### Game character
Imagine you are playing an online game and have a base character NFT. You can customize this character by equipping it with various items like armor, weapons, and accessories, each represented as separate NFTs. These items can change the character's appearance and attributes, providing a unique and personalized gaming experience. This customization is straightforward and intuitive, similar to dressing up a virtual character in different outfits and gear.

### Music track
Imagine you are a music producer. You start with a several beat NFT as the base, then add separate NFTs for guitar riffs, bass lines, and drum elements. By mixing these NFTs, you create unique tracks, with each element customizable and tradable. This allows you to use the same beat NFT across multiple tracks while varying other layers to produce different compositions.


## Key Features

### Enhanced Personalization
Customizable NFTs allow users to personalize their digital assets by equipping them with other NFTs. This can include adding new features, appearances, or functionalities, making each NFT unique.

### Multi-Layered Ownership
These NFTs support multi-layered ownership structures, where a single NFT can own multiple other NFTs. This enables the creation of complex asset hierarchies and enhances the flexibility and utility of digital assets.

### Visual and Functional Changes
Customizable NFTs can undergo visual and functional changes based on the equipped NFTs. This provides a dynamic and engaging experience for users, as their NFTs can evolve and adapt over time.

### No Smart Contracts Required
Customizable NFTs can be created and managed without the need for complex smart contract development. This simplifies the process and reduces potential security risks associated with smart contracts.

## Use Case Examples

### Gaming
Players can customize their game assets by choosing from a variety of options for environments, characters, and tools, creating a personalized gaming experience.

### Fashion & Retail
Customers can design their own clothing by selecting styles, colors, and accessories from a brand's digital collection, making each piece unique to their taste.

### Music & Entertainment
Fans can customize their fan-cards by collecting badges from each concert they attend, creating a personalized memento of their concert experiences.

### Art & Digital Collectibles

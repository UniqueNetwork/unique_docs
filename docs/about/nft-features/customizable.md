# Customizable NFTs

> At Unique Network, we see NFTs as metadata containers, not just collectible images. Want to learn more? Check out [Our Approach to NFTs](../approach.md). We bring this vision to life through our features. Explore the full list here: [NFT Features Overview](../token-types/nft.md).

Customizable NFTs are designed to allow users to modify and personalize their digital assets. Building on the foundation of dynamic and nested NFTs, the concept of customizable NFTs further expands the landscape of digital asset interaction. In these cases, the trigger that causes the NFT change is an ‚Äòupdate of NFTs relationships‚Äô event: creation of the NFT bundle or its recomposition in various ways. Customizable NFTs allow for the crafting of specific collections with predetermined roles and relationships, enabling users to create intricate and interactive digital assets.

## To put it simply

Imagine you are a music producer. You start with a beat NFT as the base, then add separate NFTs for guitar riffs, bass lines, and drum elements. By mixing these NFTs, you create unique tracks, with each element separate and tradable. This also allows you to use the same beat NFT across multiple tracks while varying other layers to produce different compositions.

## Key Features

- **Enhanced Personalization**:
  Customizable NFTs allow users to personalize their digital assets by equipping them with other NFTs. This can include adding new features, appearances, or functionalities, making each NFT unique.

- **Multi-Layered Ownership**:
  These NFTs support multi-layered ownership structures, where a single NFT can own multiple other NFTs. This enables the creation of complex asset hierarchies and enhances the flexibility and utility of digital assets.

- **Visual and Functional Changes**:
  Customizable NFTs can undergo visual and functional changes based on the equipped NFTs. This provides a dynamic and engaging experience for users, as their NFTs can evolve and adapt over time.

- **No Smart Contracts Required**:
  Customizable NFTs can be created and managed without the need for complex smart contract development. This simplifies the process and reduces potential security risks associated with smart contracts.

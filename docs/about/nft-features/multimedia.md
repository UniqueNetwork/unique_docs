# Multimedia NFTs

> At Unique Network, we see NFTs as metadata containers, not just collectible images. Want to learn more? Check out [Our Approach to NFTs](../approach.md). We bring this vision to life through our features. Explore the full list here: [NFT Features Overview](../token-types/nft.md).

Multimedia NFTs are a unique NFT format that enables the storage of multiple files within a single token. These NFTs seamlessly integrate various file types such as images, videos, audio, 3D models, PDFs, text, or JSON files, without the need for complex smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Store Any Digital Files in One NFT**:
  Enjoy maximum convenience by storing diverse media formats in a single NFT or several files of the same format, the choice is yours.
  
- **Add New Files Over Time**:
  Greater flexibility and customization as you can update your NFT with new files whenever needed.
  
- **Seamless Integration**:
  Integrate various media formats and structured data to transform how you share, collaborate, and interact with digital assets.

## Use Cases

- **Advanced NFT Collections**:
  Traditional NFTs typically feature a single image per token. With Multimedia NFTs, we can add elements such as a GIF, 3D model, and even an MP3 file.

- **Programmable Elements**:
  A Multimedia NFT can store technical data in it. For example, you can put a JSON file with various information such as personalized settings along with character images or video. As users interact with your dApp, you can update the JSON file within the NFT to reflect changes.

# Native NFTs

> At Unique Network, we see NFTs as metadata containers, not just collectible images. Want to learn more? Check out [Our Approach to NFTs](../approach.md). We bring this vision to life through our features. Explore the full list here: [NFT Features Overview](../token-types/nft.md).

Native NFTs on Unique Network represent a groundbreaking approach to creating and managing non-fungible tokens. Unlike traditional NFTs that rely heavily on smart contracts, Native NFTs are built directly into the blockchain protocol. This integration offers significant advantages in terms of simplicity, speed, cost efficiency, and security, making them a superior choice for a wide range of applications.

## How Unique Native NFTs differs from Smart Contract NFTs (Old Approach)

Smart Contract NFTs, also known as traditional NFTs, typically reside on blockchains like Ethereum and require smart contracts for their creation and management. These NFTs have become the standard by being the first to leverage existing blockchain infrastructure, even though it was not originally designed to store them. 

**To put it simply** 
Let's say need a car. And you decide to build it from scratch. You hire a team of designers and engineers, find a nearest manufacturer and make an order. After several months, you finally have a custom-built car, you send it for safety audit and it hopefully passes. However, any future repairs or upgrades will require going back to the original team, and if they missed something, like windshield wipers, you're stuck with the issue. This represents the traditional smart contract NFTs, which are complex and require experienced developers and ongoing expensive support.

#### Disadvantages
- **Complexity**: The use of smart contracts requires technical knowledge, making it less accessible for non-developers.
- **Cost**: Deploying and interacting with smart contracts can be expensive due to high transaction fees, especially on networks like Ethereum.
- **Security Risks**: Smart contracts are prone to vulnerabilities and exploits, which can lead to significant financial losses if not properly audited and secured.
- **Scalability**: High demand on networks like Ethereum can lead to congestion and slow transaction times.

### Native NFTs (Our Approach)

Native NFTs are an NFT format built by the Unique Network blockchain that enables the minting of NFTs in seconds without using smart contracts or complex tools. This streamlined process offers greater accessibility and efficiency for creating and managing NFTs. **Native NFTs fully support the ERC-721 standard and its extensions**, ensuring compatibility and interoperability while providing additional flexibility and freedom.

**To put it simply**

You need a car. You go to a reputable car dealership. The dealership has already taken care of everything – design, manufacturing, safety tests, and regulatory compliance. You simply choose the car you like, pay for it, and drive away. The process is quick, safe, and hassle-free. This is akin to Native NFTs on our chain, where everything is streamlined and user-friendly.

## Native NFTs Key Features

- **Simplified Creation and Management**:
  Native NFTs eliminate the need for complex smart contracts, streamlining the creation and management process. This accessibility allows users, regardless of their technical expertise, to mint NFTs in seconds. The straightforward process encourages broader adoption and experimentation with NFTs.

- **Customization and Flexibility**:
  Native NFTs are fully compatible with the ERC-721 standard, but offering extensive customization options. This flexibility allows creators to define unique attributes and functionalities for their NFTs, catering to specific needs and enhancing the value proposition of their digital assets.

- **Enhanced Speed and Efficiency**:
  The absence of smart contract execution in Native NFTs results in faster minting and transaction times. This efficiency ensures a seamless user experience, particularly important during periods of high network activity. Quick processing times enhance user satisfaction and facilitate real-time interactions.

- **Cost Efficiency**:
  Native NFTs significantly reduce transaction fees by bypassing the need for smart contracts. Lower costs make it economically viable for users to create, trade, and manage NFTs, fostering a more inclusive environment for NFT innovation. This affordability is crucial for attracting new users and supporting diverse use cases.

- **Robust Security**:
  By embedding NFT functionality directly into the blockchain, Native NFTs minimize the security risks associated with smart contracts, such as vulnerabilities and exploits. This intrinsic security framework provides a more reliable environment for managing digital assets, ensuring the integrity and safety of NFT transactions.

Provide 10 ready-to-implement ideas that are likely to be popular with users. Describe each idea in detail and explain why you think users will like it. Consider the following advanced features of Unique Network NFTs:

- **Native NFTs**: Built directly into the blockchain protocol, allowing for simplified creation and management without the need for smart contracts. This ensures faster transactions, lower costs, and enhanced security.
- **Multimedia NFTs**: Store and update multiple file types (e.g., images, audio, video, 3D models, documents) within a single NFT, offering greater flexibility and richer user experiences.
- **Nested NFTs**: Enable an NFT to own other NFTs, forming hierarchical structures. This allows for complex asset organization and management, such as bundling in-game items or creating collections of related assets.
- **Dynamic NFTs**: Capable of changing their metadata based on external triggers, such as user interactions, in-game achievements, or real-time data feeds. This feature enables continuous engagement and evolving digital assets.
- **Customizable NFTs**: Allow users to modify and personalize their NFTs by equipping them with other NFTs. This supports specific collections with predetermined roles and relationships, enhancing personalization and structured ownership.
- **Composable NFTs**: Provide the freedom to combine different NFTs without preset rules, allowing for the creation of entirely new entities. This feature supports dynamic and flexible asset composition, fostering unlimited creative possibilities.

Focus on the use cases where users or industry can really benefit from using NFTs and not web 2.0 approaches:
- **On-Chain Data**: Storing critical information directly on the blockchain ensures immutability and transparency.
- **Unique Metadata**: Each NFT contains unique metadata that provides detailed information about the asset it represents.
- **Immutable Proof of Ownership**: NFTs offer a secure and tamper-proof record of ownership, ensuring that the true owner of a digital or physical asset can always be verified.
- **Verification of Authenticity**: NFTs enable the verification of an asset’s authenticity, reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting.
- **Decentralization**: Operating on decentralized networks reduces reliance on centralized authorities.
- **Co-Creation Trend**: As NFTs gain popularity worldwide, there is a growing trend towards co-creation. Unique Network NFTs are perfectly suited for this trend, allowing for collaborative and innovative solutions.
- **Flexibility and Innovation**: The NFT standard is continually evolving, with new use cases and applications emerging regularly. This flexibility allows for constant innovation and adaptation to new technological and market developments.

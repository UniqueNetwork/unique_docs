# Composable NFTs

> At Unique Network, we see NFTs as metadata containers, not just collectible images. Want to learn more? Check out [Our Approach to NFTs](../approach.md). We bring this vision to life through our features. Explore the full list here: [NFT Features Overview](../token-types/nft.md).

Composable NFTs represent a new frontier in the world of digital assets by allowing multiple NFTs to be combined and restructured in flexible and innovative ways. Unlike Customizable NFTs, which focus on modifying individual NFTs by adding or removing predefined elements, Composable NFTs offer complete freedom to combine different NFTs without any preset rules. This approach enhances the utility, value, and engagement of NFTs, opening up new possibilities for creativity and customization.

## To put it simply

Consider an art project where you can either create a collage (Customizable NFTs) or paint on a blank canvas (Composable NFTs). In the first scenario, you have a set of predefined stickers and positions where you can place them. Your creativity is limited to the options provided by the creator. In the second scenario, you have complete freedom to paint, combine different materials, and create an entirely unique piece without any restrictions. This flexibility and lack of predefined roles are what make Composable NFTs truly special.

## Key Features

- **Unlimited Creativity**:
  Composable NFTs enable users to combine different digital assets without any predefined roles, fostering creativity and innovation. This allows for the creation of complex and unique compositions that would not be possible with standalone or customizable NFTs.

- **Increased Utility**:
  By merging multiple NFTs, users can create assets with enhanced functionality and value. This can include combining visual, audio, and interactive elements to create rich and engaging digital experiences.

- **No Smart Contracts Required**:
  Composable NFTs can be created and managed without the need for complex smart contract development. This simplifies the process and reduces potential security risks associated with smart contracts.

## Use Case Examples

### üéÆ Gaming
Players can combine different NFT-based game assets like terrains, buildings, and NPCs to create unique gaming levels or experiences, offering unlimited creative freedom.

### üëó Fashion & Retail
Shoppers mix and match individual garment NFTs from arbitrary collections to create complete outfits, sharing or trading looks with others, without any preset combinations.

### üéµ Music & Entertainment
Users create unique music experiences by compiling a track list from various artists, with each track represented as an NFT. Create music compositions by creating a time-based sample and track segment arrangement (audio-NFT compositing).

### üñºÔ∏è Art & Digital Collectibles
- **Virtual Galleries**: Art enthusiasts create personalized art exhibitions by combining artworks from different artists into a single, navigable 3D space, allowing for unique and dynamic displays.

### üè† Real Estate & Virtual Spaces
Users can create complex structures by combining basic building block NFTs, allowing for the construction of unique virtual environments, providing complete architectural freedom.

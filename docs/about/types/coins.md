# Fungible

## What is it? 

Actually, **fungibility** is an economic term that describes the interchangeability of certain goods. For example, a dollar bill equals any other dollar bill, while a non-fungible token is unique and inimitable. For example, if you have a dollar bill signed by a famous artist, it becomes unique.

Familiarity with the concept of **fungibility** in economics might help one better understand fungible and **non-fungible** tokens. The only difference is that crypto tokens express their **fungibility** property through a code script.

**Fungible** tokens or assets are divisible and non-unique. For instance, fiat currencies like the dollar are fungible: A $1 bill in New York City has the same value as a $1 bill in Miami. A fungible token can also be a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin: 1 BTC is worth 1 BTC, no matter where it is issued. 

**NFTs** differ from fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, which are identical to each other and, therefore, can serve as a medium for commercial transactions (e.g., for buying goods).

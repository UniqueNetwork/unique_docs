# NFTs

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item, whether digital or physical.

At Unique Network, we approach NFTs as both a groundbreaking technology and versatile metadata containers. This perspective allows us to unlock a wide range of applications and functionalities beyond traditional use cases. Learn more about our innovative approach and the potential of NFTs [here](../approach.md).

#### Native and Multimedia NFTs

All NFTs on Unique Network are both Native and Multimedia. This foundational approach ensures that NFTs are integrated directly into the blockchain protocol and can store multiple file types within a single token.

- [Native NFTs](../nft-features/native.md): Simplified creation and management, enhanced security, and cost efficiency.
- [Multimedia NFTs](../nft-features/multimedia.md): Ability to store and update multiple file types, providing enhanced flexibility and customization.

## Advanced NFT features overview

The advanced features of NFTs on Unique Network are designed to complement and enhance each other. The core features:

- **Nested NFTs** provide the ability to create hierarchical structures in one transfer transaction.
- **Dynamic NFTs** enable real-time updates and interactivity.

Using these, more advanced configurations can be created:
- **Customizable NFTs = Nested + Dynamic + Predefined equipment rules**
- **Composable NFTs = Nested + Dynamic + Unlimited user creativity**

The NFT features listed here are not fixed types of NFTs; there's no need to choose in advance. Any collection owner has the flexibility to utilize them, adding additional functionalities even after the collection is created. You can combine features to achieve the desired result or restrict all modifications to ensure that the collection remains unchanged forever.

These capabilities are managed through collection settings, providing complete control over how your NFTs evolve and interact. 


## 1. Nested NFTs

[Nested NFTs](../nft-features/nested.md) allow one NFT to own other NFTs, forming a hierarchical structure, in one transfer transaction. This nesting mechanism enables the creation of complex digital assets within a single token, enhancing the functionality and organizational structure of NFTs.

## 2. Dynamic NFTs

[Dynamic NFTs](../nft-features/dynamic.md) stand at the forefront of digital innovation, with the ability to alter their metadata in response to external triggers. These triggers can range from in-app or on-chain events and user interactions to real-time data feeds from external APIs.

#### Key Benefits:
- Continuous engagement through dynamic updates
- Real-time interaction based on external data
- Transformation from static to living digital assets

## 3. Customizable NFTs

[Customizable NFTs](../nft-features/customizable.md) allow users to modify and personalize their digital assets. By equipping NFTs with other NFTs, users can create specific collections with predetermined roles and relationships.

#### Key Benefits:
- Enhanced personalization and customization
- Structured approach to NFT relationships

## 4. Composable NFTs

[Composable NFTs](../nft-features/composable.md) offer complete freedom to combine different NFTs without any preset rules. This feature enables the creation of entirely new entities by merging various NFTs, allowing for unmatched creativity and innovation.

#### Key Benefits:
- Unlimited creative possibilities
- Dynamic and flexible asset composition

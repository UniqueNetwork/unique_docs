# Coins

In the realm of blockchain technology, coins serve as essential components of the ecosystem. They can be categorized into native and non-native coins, each with its unique properties and use cases.

## Native Coins

### Definition
Native coins are integral to their specific blockchain. They are used primarily for transactions, staking, and governance within their respective networks.

### Characteristics
- **Native to Blockchain**: Native coins are created and used within a particular blockchain.
- **Utility**: They are used to incentivize network participants, pay for transaction fees, and enable other functionalities within the blockchain ecosystem.

### Native Coins Examples
- **Bitcoin (BTC)**
- **Ethereum (ETH)**
- **Polkadot (DOT)**
- **Unique Network (UNQ): The native currency of Unique Network**


## Non-Native Coins

### Definition
In addition to native coins, blockchain networks also support fungible tokens that operate on the same network. These tokens can represent a variety of assets and are typically used for decentralized applications (dApps) and other blockchain-based services.

### Characteristics
- **Interoperability**: Non-native coins can interact with various dApps and services within the blockchain ecosystem.
- **Flexibility**: They can represent a wide range of assets and be used for multiple purposes, including governance, utility, and financial transactions.

### ERC-20 Tokens
ERC-20 is a widely adopted standard for creating fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens can be transferred between accounts and are used to incentivize and manage decentralized applications.

### Examples of ERC-20 Tokens
- **Tether (USDT)**: A stablecoin that is pegged to the value of the US dollar, widely used in trading and as a store of value.
- **Chainlink (LINK)**: A decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts on Ethereum to securely connect to external data sources, APIs, and payment systems.
- **Uniswap (UNI)**: The governance token for the Uniswap decentralized exchange, allowing holders to participate in the decision-making process for the protocol.

## Unique Network and ERC-20 Support

Unique Network fully supports the ERC-20 standard, enabling the creation and management of fungible tokens within its ecosystem. This compatibility allows developers and businesses to leverage existing tools and infrastructure, ensuring seamless integration and operation.

### Use Cases for ERC-20 Support
- **Tokenized Assets**: Represent real-world assets such as commodities, real estate, or even intellectual property as ERC-20 tokens.
- **Incentive Programs**: Develop and implement reward programs using ERC-20 tokens to incentivize user participation and loyalty.
- **Governance**: Utilize ERC-20 tokens for decentralized governance, allowing stakeholders to vote on key decisions affecting the ecosystem.

# Overview

In the world of blockchain technology, there are various types of tokens that serve different purposes and functionalities. This section will explain the primary types of tokens, and clarify the differences between them:

- [NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)](#non-fungible-tokens-nfts)
- [Fractional NFTs](#fractional-nfts-rfts)
- [Coins](#coins)

## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)

### Definition

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a specific item, whether digital or physical. Unlike coins, NFTs are not interchangeable on a one-to-one basis, as each NFT has unique properties and value.

**Real-World Analogy**

NFTs are like unique assets (e.g., a university diploma, a property deed, or a collectible item). Each item has its own unique value and characteristics, and they are not interchangeable on a one-to-one basis.

### Characteristics

- **Non-Fungibility**: Each NFT is unique and cannot be replaced with another NFT. This uniqueness is what gives NFTs their value.
- **Metadata**: NFTs contain metadata that provides detailed information about the asset they represent, such as the creator, ownership history, and specific attributes.

## Fractional NFTs (RFTs)

### Definition

Fractional NFTs, also known as Re-Fungible Tokens (RFTs), allow for the division of an NFT into multiple fungible tokens, enabling shared ownership of a single NFT. This process typically involves locking an NFT in a smart contract and issuing ERC-20 tokens that represent shares of the NFT.

**Real-World Analogy**

Fractional NFTs are like owning shares in a company. Instead of owning the entire company, you own a percentage of it, which is represented by the shares you hold.

### Characteristics

- **Shared Ownership**: Fractional NFTs enable multiple people to own a portion of a single NFT, democratizing access to valuable or high-priced digital assets.
- **Liquidity**: By dividing an NFT into fungible tokens, it becomes easier to buy, sell, and trade smaller portions of the asset, increasing its liquidity.
- **Flexibility**: Fractional NFTs provide more flexibility in how digital assets can be owned, traded, and utilized.

## Coins

### Definition

Coins, also known as cryptocurrencies, are digital currencies that operate independently of a central authority. They are used primarily as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account.

**Real-World Analogy**

Think of coins like traditional currencies (e.g., USD, EUR). Each dollar bill is identical in value and can be used interchangeably for goods and services.

### Characteristics

- **Fungibility**: Coins are fungible, meaning each coin is identical in value and function to another. For example, one Bitcoin is equal in value to another Bitcoin.
- **Use Cases**: Coins are typically used for transactions, investments, and as a means of transferring value. They can also be used to pay for goods and services.

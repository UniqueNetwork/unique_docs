# Why we believe in NFT  

The landscape of NFTs is evolving rapidly. While early iterations of NFTs focused primarily on digital art and collectibles, the future holds much more significant potential. NFTs are reshaping various industries by introducing verifiable ownership, scarcity, and interoperability in digital and physical assets. They are not just about owning a piece of art or a collectible; they represent a paradigm shift in how we perceive ownership and value in the digital age.

NFTs provide a unique way to ensure the authenticity and provenance of assets, making them invaluable for sectors where proof of ownership, originality, and history are crucial. The integration of NFTs into more advanced use cases, such as digital identity, real estate, and supply chain management, demonstrates their potential to revolutionize these fields.

As we move forward, the demand for more efficient, scalable, and secure NFT solutions will only grow. Native NFTs, which are simpler, faster, and more cost-effective, are positioned to meet these demands better than traditional smart contract-based NFTs. The future of NFTs lies in their ability to seamlessly integrate into various applications, and Native NFTs, with their enhanced usability and lower barriers to entry, represent the next step in this evolution.

## NFT is a How, not a What 

Think of NFTs as the plastic cards of the digital age. They can be anything: a membership card, a bank account, a coffee shop loyalty card, or your apartment ownership confirmation. It's not about what they are, but how they function. NFTs represent a powerful technology with specific technical features that provide substantial benefits across various industries.

- **Verification of Authenticity**: NFTs enable the verification of an assetâ€™s authenticity, reducing the risk of fraud and counterfeiting. 

  Imagine graduating from a university and receiving your diploma as an NFT. With NFTs, employers and institutions can instantly verify its authenticity, ensuring your credentials are genuine and eliminating the risk of fake diplomas. Your competitor with a counterfeit diploma is no longer a threat in the job market.

- **Immutable Proof of Ownership**: NFTs offer a secure and tamper-proof record of ownership, ensuring that the true owner of a digital or physical asset can always be verified.

  Imagine inheriting a family estate and receiving an NFT that represents the title deed. This NFT provides a secure and tamper-proof record of ownership, making it impossible for anyone to contest your inheritance, eliminating the risk of inheritance disputes.

- **Unique Metadata**: Each NFT contains unique metadata that provides detailed information about the asset it represents, such as ownership history, creation date, and provenance. 

  Imagine writing and recording a song for the first time. The NFT for this song contains unique metadata, detailing its creation date, your authorship, and other important attributes. This ensures that no one else can claim rights to your work.

- **On-Chain Data**: Storing critical information directly on the blockchain ensures immutability and transparency. 

  Imagine having government officials' tax declarations or budget expenditure data stored on the blockchain. This ensures that the data is immutable and transparent, making it easier for citizens to verify the proper use of public funds and hold officials accountable.

- **Decentralization**: Operating on decentralized networks reduces reliance on centralized authorities. This ensures greater security, transparency, and resistance to censorship.

  Imagine the records of your car ownership being stored on a decentralized network. This ensures that even if the government registry is hacked or fails, the data proving that the car belongs to you remains accessible and secure.

- **Flexibility and Innovation**: The NFT standard is continually evolving, with new use cases and applications emerging regularly. This flexibility allows for constant innovation and adaptation to new technological and market developments.

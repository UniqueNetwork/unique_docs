# Dynamic NFTs

## What are Dynamic NFTs?
Dynamic NFTs are an NFT format supporting token changes or evolving over time, typically based on pre-set rules, user interactions, or real-world data.

## Why are Dynamic NFTs unique?
- Any information can be used as a source. For example, any information from any API service for news/weather/Bitcoin price and any other information
- No need for blockchain knowledge. Accessible for web2 and web3 developers
- Smart contracts not required

## Use cases
- Dynamic Artwork changing based on specific conditions or triggers
- Interactive Game NFT – Game items or characters as Dynamic NFTs can evolve, level up, or change based on gameplay
- Reward Systems – Dynamic NFTs can represent a reward system, changing based on the owner's actions or milestones

## Monetization ideas
- Exclusive Updates – Charge for updates or changes to the dynamic NFTs
- Subscription Services – Users could pay a subscription fee to receive and interact with dynamic NFTs
- Tiered Levels – Dynamic NFTs could be sold at different price levels, each offering different interactive elements

## How can Dynamic NFTs benefit your users?
- Interactive – Dynamic NFTs offer an interactive and engaging experience that traditional NFTs cannot
- Uniqueness – The ability for an NFT to change over time makes each dynamic NFT unique
- Novelty – The evolving nature of dynamic NFTs keeps the user experience fresh and exciting
- Personalized experience – User interactions shaping the NFT can result in a highly personalized ownership experience

## How can I create Dynamic NFTs?

- Design your collection, develop the collection tokens traits, and prepare the digital assets (image, audio, video, doc).
- Set up the development environment for using the SDK in two easy steps (step-by-step setup video [here](https://youtu.be/StfRap-dvks))
- Establishing your own compositing server to observe customizations during development is recommended. The server merges nested NFTs, presents modifications in dynamic NFTs, and more
- The process can be expedited by bringing your own server. More information about the setup can be found in this repo, and you can view an example in this video
- Check out the [Dynamic NFT workshop](https://youtu.be/YHGS4Z7Yxm8), which delves into a practical method of connecting Dynamic NFTs to signal sources and mutators.
- Mint the NFTs using the SDK (as shown in the workshop [here](https://youtu.be/StfRap-dvks))
- See results in the UniqueWallet

## How can I create Customizable NFTs?

The SDK provides full control over the creation and customization process described in the [SDK documentation](/sdk/).

The process consists of the following steps:

1. Design your collection, create the collection tokens traits, and prepare the digital assets (image, audio, video, doc).
2. Set up the development environment for using the SDK in two easy steps (step-by-step setup video [here](https://youtu.be/StfRap-dvks))
3. Establishing your compositing server to observe customizations during development is recommended. The server merges nested NFTs and presents modifications in dynamic NFTs and more.
4. The process can be expedited by bringing your server. More information about the setup can be found in this repo, and you can view an example in this [video](https://youtu.be/YHGS4Z7Yxm8)
5. Mint the tokens via a simple call. You can mass-mint with just one call!
6. Examine the results in the UniqueWallet and use the wallet interface for further customization and nesting.

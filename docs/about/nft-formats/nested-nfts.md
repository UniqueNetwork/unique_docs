# Nested NFTs

## What are Nested NFTs?
Nested NFT is a format that allows one NFT to own other NFTs. This nesting mechanism enables the creation of unique and complex hierarchies of digital assets within a single token, turning it into a multi-dimensional, multi-layered entity.

## Why are Nested NFTs unique?
- No Smart Contracts Required – Create and manage nested structures without the need for complex smart contract development.
- Hierarchical Structures – Nested NFTs allow embedding or linking one NFT within another, creating rich, hierarchical digital asset structures.
- Simplified Management – Manage many assets via a single token, simplifying the portfolio and transaction processes.

## Use cases
- Digital Storytelling – Authors could nest chapters or scenes within a complete book or movie NFT.
- Complex Collectibles – Create sets of collectibles where specific NFTs belong to a larger set.
- Art Installations – Represent physical art installations as a primary NFT, with individual pieces as nested NFTs.

## Monetization ideas
- Exclusive Bundles – Sell Nested NFTs as exclusive, limited edition bundles of related items.
- Unlockable Content – Initial NFT could provide access to additional, nested content that becomes available over time or based on certain conditions.
- Portfolio Sales – Artists could sell a portfolio of their work as a single Nested NFT, creating a new way to distribute and monetize art collections.

## How can Nested NFTs benefit your users?
- Enhanced Interactivity – enables unique interactions between nested elements, offering users a rich and engaging experience.
- Increased Value – the ability to nest NFTs could create new value dynamics, as certain combinations of nested assets might become highly sought after.
- Creative Freedom – Nested NFTs allow new artistic and creative expression forms, enabling intricate and multi-layered digital creations.

## How can I create Nested NFTs?
1. Create an NFT Collection in the Unique Wallet
2. Set Nesting Settings

Nested NFTs redefine the boundaries of what NFTs can represent, offering a world of possibilities for creators, collectors, and developers alike.

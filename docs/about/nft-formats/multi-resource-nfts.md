# Multi-resource NFTs

## What are Multi-resource NFTs?
Multi-resource NFTs are a unique NFT format that enables the storage of multiple files within a single token.

Seamlessly integrate any file type, images, videos, audio, or structured documents like Word or JSON files into your NFTs without the need for complex smart contracts.

## Why are Multi-resource NFTs unique?
- Store any digital file in one NFT. Enjoy maximum convenience
- Add new files over time for greater flexibility and customization
- Seamlessly integrate various media formats and structured data. Completely transforms how you share, collaborate, and interact with digital assets

## Use cases
- Advanced NFT collections – store several resources
  - EXAMPLE: Our Substrapunk NFTs are currently accompanied by a single image per token. However, through the multi-resource NFTs feature, we can incorporate additional elements such as a 3D image of Substrapunk, a GIF, and even Substrapunk's voice using an MP3 file.
- Multimedia entertainment – A single NFT could hold a movie, its soundtrack and associated artwork
- Exclusive media content and releases

## Monetization ideas
- Sell more advanced NFT collections
- Partnership ideas
- Unlockable content

## How can Multi-resource NFTs benefit your users?
- With the ability to bundle images, videos, audio, and structured documents simultaneously, users can create immersive experiences like never before
- Users enjoy multiple digital assets linked to a single token, increasing its value and utility
- The bundled digital assets can offer a unique experience that standalone NFTs may not provide
- Combining multiple media resources creates several special opportunities and use cases. Think immersive presentations, interactive training modules, and engaging product showcases.

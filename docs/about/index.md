# Unique Network

Unique Network is the next-generation NFT chain for advanced use cases and mass adoption.

We are in the very early stages of discovering use cases for NFTs. They are the Web3 component for managing any unique assets, having the potential for thousands of use cases and becoming the core technology everyone uses. 

The main direction we see is infrastructure development and support for the following points:

- more advanced use cases;
- scalability to serve billions of users;
- tools to hide blockchain's complexity and barriers for Web2 users;
- the biggest market for unique assets is Real Estate, but NFTs will be mainly focused on digital real estate in the next decade, as well as digital fashion, games, etc.;
- additional point - developer ecosystem size, second only to Ethereum.

## Sponsoring

Unique Network provides sponsored transactions. This feature allows end users not even to know that they need to pay some transaction fees. This is because the developers can hide these fees, and the actions with the user interface will not mention additional costs.

In Unique Network, the following types of transactions can be sponsored:

- Minting NFTs
- NFT transfers
- Smart contract calls, etc.

See [Sponsoring](../concepts/network-features/sponsoring.md) for more details.

<!-- ### USDT on Unique
TODO mention USDT when it will be there

Unique Network provides native USDT support via XCM.

Today, IDEX is the most advanced exchange on Ethereum. By deploying to Moonbeam, IDEX is able to include assets from Polkadot and its parachains in their exchange without making major changes to their existing code. Moonbeam's interoperability with other parachains will help bridge IDEX to the many projects (and their tokens) coming to Polkadot. -->

## Staking

We provide an on-chain staking mechanism called the App promotion staking. This program is designed to motivate the application developers to use the parachains and attract token holders to the most recent applications, which in turn will attract many end users. The application developers newly joining the network will be granted a transaction fee stipend, allowing them to execute a starting number of free transactions.

<!-- ## Paying fees with fungible tokens
TODO mention when it will be there

Unique Network provides a way to pay transaction fees with fungible collections. It is possible to create your own cryptocurrency on our network and it will be represented as a fungible collection. Then, you can use this new cryptocurrency to pay transaction fees instead/along with the native network tokens (after our approval). This may be provide additional benefits and possibilities for games on our network. -->

## Enormous amount of capabilities

Unique Network provides a vast range of features never seen before:
- native, extremely scalable, and flexible NFT minting and management;
- nesting - the ability to make a bundle of several NFTs and trade it in one;
- RFT: minted and then partially transferred to multiple owners;
- scheduling, layered rights management, and other;
- tools that enable Web2 experience for users and developers (advanced gas sponsoring, SDK, etc.);
- fully compatible with classic Ethereum tools: EVM with full Solidity support, metamask, ethers, hardhat, truffle - everything as usual. All our technologies are provided as Solidity interfaces and can be used as an easy drop-in replacement for OpenZeppelin libraries;
- flexibility to develop native NFT features at any scale and complexity due to Substrate modularity and forkless upgrade capabilities;
- any media type: images, animations, videos, audio, 3D objects, and anything you want to place in.

## Pricing

The estimated minting price is about $ 0.001. So, to mint an NFT collection with 1000 items, you will need to pay just $ 1. This is one of the lowest prices on the market.

## Economy model

Unique Network provides NFT-oriented features and EVM compatibility with Ethereum API and toolchain.
We provide low costs, high transaction speeds, minimal climate impact, and good scalability.

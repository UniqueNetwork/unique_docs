# Unique Network

Unique Network is the next-generation NFT chain for advanced use cases and mass adoption.

We are in the very early stages of discovering use cases for NFTs. They are the Web3 component for managing any unique assets, having the potential for thousands of use cases and becoming the core technology everyone uses. 

The main direction we see is infrastructure development and support for the following points:

- more advanced use cases;
- scalability to serve billions of users;
- tools to hide blockchain's complexity and barriers for Web2 users;
- the biggest market for unique assets is Real Estate, but NFTs will be mainly focused on digital real estate in the next decade, as well as digital fashion, games, etc.;
- additional point - developer ecosystem size, second only to Ethereum.

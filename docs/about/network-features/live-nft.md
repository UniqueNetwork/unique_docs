# Dynamic (live) NFTs

Dynamic, 'live' NFTs represent an advanced implementation of NFTs that offer unique opportunities for
both collectors and creators. Unlike static NFTs, which represent a single digital asset, dynamic NFTs can change over time based on various conditions and triggers, allowing for a new level of interactivity and engagement.

For collectors, this offers a new level of value and engagement. By owning a dynamic NFT, collectors can experience the thrill of owning a digital asset that is constantly evolving and changing, providing a more immersive and engaging experience than traditional NFTs.

For creators, on the other hand, a whole new area of new opportunities to explore their creativity
and create more engaging and interactive digital assets opens up. By leveraging smart contracts,
creators can program their dynamic NFTs to respond to a wide range of conditions and triggers,
such as user interaction, time of day, or changes in the environment. Since the underlying conditions
provide a 'stimulus' for the perpetual change and potential growth of the dynamic NFT, it almost makes sense to observe this process as an organic process.  
Hence, calling it a 'live' NFT is not too far from how we experience it. Expanding on this concept, in considering how the dynamic NFT changes,
it is fair to introduce the concept of 'mutation' - as it is a change of an NFT's attribute through time as a result of external conditions. It is imaginable to foresee that a 'mutation' service could be provided
as a general and dynamic NFT modifier service for any dynamic NFT that subscribes to it, independent of the collection creator.
For example, a 'Halofier' mutator creates halos of different and changing forms that add a halo to a character.
Or a 'tourist' mutator that changes a background to a popular tourist location that reflects the time of day at that location.  
This allows creators to experiment with new forms of digital art and storytelling and can potentially open up new revenue streams through the sale and licensing of their dynamic NFTs.

Additionally, dynamic NFTs can be used to create new forms of digital experiences that are more immersive and engaging than traditional digital content. For example, a dynamic NFT could be used to create an
interactive game or virtual world that evolves and changes over time based on user input.

Overall, dynamic NFTs represent a significant advancement in the world of NFTs, expanding the boundaries
of digital art and storytelling, and creating new forms of engaging and interactive digital experiences.

Here are **ten examples** of how dynamic NFTs can be used:

**Gaming**: dynamic NFTs can be used in games to represent items that have different properties, such as weapons or armor.
These items can change in response to the player's actions or the game environment, making the gameplay more immersive and engaging.
The 'state' of every NFT in a bundle could be reflected by a meaningful changing representation.

**Art**: dynamic NFTs can be used in digital art to create pieces that evolve over time. For example, an artist
could create a piece that changes color or shape or some subtle form of expression in response to different
weather conditions or the time of day.

**Music**: dynamic NFTs can be used in music to create songs that change over time. For example, a musician
could create a song that evolves based on the listener's mood or ambient conditions.

**Sports**: dynamic NFTs can be used in sports to represent athletes or teams. These NFTs can change in value
based on the performance of the athlete or team, making them a valuable collectible for fans.

**Advertising**: dynamic NFTs can be used in advertising to create interactive campaigns that change over time.
For example, a company could create an NFT that changes in response to social media engagement or website traffic.

**Education**: dynamic NFTs can be used in education to create interactive learning experiences.
For example, a teacher could create an NFT that changes in response to the student's progress, providing feedback and encouragement.

**Real Estate**: dynamic NFTs can be used in real estate to represent properties that change in value over time.
For example, an NFT could represent a piece of land that increases in value as new developments are built in the area.

**Health**: dynamic NFTs can be used in healthcare to track patients' health data over time.
For example, an NFT could represent a patient's health record, which would update automatically as new data is added.

**Social Media**: dynamic NFTs can be used in social media to create personalized avatars or profiles that change over time.
For example, an NFT could represent a user's profile picture, which changes in response to the user's activity or preferences.

**Charity**: dynamic NFTs can be used in charity fundraising to create tokens that change in value based on the
success of the campaign. For example, an NFT could represent a charitable donation, which increases in value as more people contribute.

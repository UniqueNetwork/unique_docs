# Pricing

## Optimized NFT Actions

At Unique Network, we have optimized all actions with NFTs to ensure cost-efficiency. The cost for creating an NFT collection is always fixed at 2 tokens, regardless of the network:

- **Unique Network**: 2 UNQ
- **Quartz**: 2 QTZ

This fixed pricing model makes it straightforward to understand the costs associated with creating and managing your digital assets on our platforms.

The estimated minting price on our mainnet (Unique) is approximately $0.001. For example, minting an NFT collection with 1000 items would only cost about $1, one of the lowest prices on the market.

By maintaining these affordable and predictable costs, we aim to make NFT creation accessible to everyone, from individual creators to large enterprises.

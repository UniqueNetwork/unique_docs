# EVM and Smart Contracts

Unique Network leverages Substrate’s flexibility to deliver native NFT features while supporting EVM compatibility. This dual approach boosts scalability and customization in digital asset management, enabling Ethereum toolsets to manipulate NFTs on Unique Network. Consequently, developers can use Solidity and other Ethereum standards for NFT interactions, creating a flexible development environment within the Polkadot ecosystem.

## EVM Smart Contracts

Unique Network fully supports standard EVM smart contracts, allowing developers to leverage existing Ethereum tools and frameworks. This means you can use familiar tools like Metamask and Ethereum clients to interact with NFTs on Unique Network.

## Interoperability with Substrate and Ethereum APIs

Unique Network ensures seamless interoperability between Substrate and Ethereum APIs. This dual support allows for the creation and management of collections using the Substrate API while enabling interactions via the Ethereum API, and vice versa.

Unique Network’s native features work seamlessly within the EVM environment, providing additional functionalities not typically available on standard Ethereum platforms.

Native collections are presented as contracts (ERC721-like) and can be interacted with via Ethereum clients and tools.

## Benefits for Developers

- **Flexibility**: By supporting both Substrate and Ethereum toolsets, Unique Network provides a flexible development environment that accommodates various use cases and preferences.
- **Scalability**: Substrate’s scalability ensures that NFT interactions and transactions can handle large volumes, making it suitable for high-demand applications.

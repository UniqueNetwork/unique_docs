# Staking

We provide an on-chain staking mechanism called the App promotion staking. This program is designed to motivate the application developers to use the parachains and attract token holders to the most recent applications, which in turn will attract many end users. The application developers newly joining the network will be granted a transaction fee stipend, allowing them to execute a starting number of free transactions.

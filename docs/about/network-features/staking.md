# Staking

Staking is a process that allows users to participate in the operation and security of a blockchain network by locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in exchange for rewards. On Unique Network, staking not only supports the ecosystem but also allows participants to earn rewards in the form of additional tokens.

Staking involves holding and "staking" your tokens to support the network's operations, such as block validation and transaction processing. In return for staking, participants receive rewards, typically in the form of additional tokens. This incentivizes users to contribute to the network's security and efficiency.

## Staking on Unique Network

Unique Network offers a straightforward staking process for its native tokens, UNQ and QTZ. By staking these tokens, users can earn rewards and support the Unique Network ecosystem. The staking process is designed to be user-friendly and accessible through the Unique Staking Hub.

### Key Benefits:
- **Earn Rewards**: Participants can earn APY rewards by staking their UNQ and QTZ tokens.
- **Support the Ecosystem**: Staking helps secure the network and supports its ongoing operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The Unique Staking Hub provides an easy-to-use platform for staking.

## How to Stake

### Step-by-Step Guide:
1. **Access the Staking Hub**: Visit the [Unique Staking Hub](https://unique.network/staking/) to get started.
2. **Connect Your Wallet**: Connect your wallet that holds UNQ or QTZ tokens.
3. **Select the Amount to Stake**: Choose the amount of tokens you wish to stake.
4. **Confirm the Transaction**: Confirm the staking transaction in your wallet.
5. **Earn Rewards**: Start earning rewards as your tokens contribute to the network's security and operations.

### Important Considerations:

- **Staking Limit**: Users can stake up to 10 times from one wallet. 
- **Staking Locked Coins**: Users can stake coins from both transferable and locked balances. The system prioritizes staking from locked balances (vesting, democracy, election), leading to a more efficient and secure staking experience while maximizing the earning potential of your entire coin balance.
    - **Example**: If you have 1000 coins (500 transferable and 500 vested) and want to stake 400 coins, they will be staked from the vested balance. If you want to stake 600 coins, 500 will come from the vested balance and 100 from the transferable balance.
- **Unstaking Lock-Up Period**: There is a one-week waiting period for tokens to arrive in the user's wallet after unstaking.

## Future Plans

Future plans for Unique Staking include the integration of AppPromotion features. This will enable UNQ/QTZ owners to influence how apps are sponsored and earn even more rewards as promoted dApps become successful.

Currently, users can stake their tokens only using Substrate wallets. However, future releases will add MetaMask staking functionality.

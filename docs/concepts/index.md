# Concepts

#### NFT 

#### RFT (fractional tokens)

The Fractional tokens provide a way for many users to own a part of an NFT. It democratizes premium digital assets through shared ownership powered by Re-Fungibile Token technology.

#### Nesting 
An NFT can contain another NFT or RFT inside. Also, you can create a bundle that contains NFT + RFT + USDT. When you send the parent NFT to someone, he/she will receive the entire bundle just in one transaction.

#### Transaction sponsoring

Usually, an end-user has to pay transaction fees when creating a collection, selling or purchasing NFTs. But, where he should get a native currency of network for this?

We, in Unique Network, solve this issue. Using sponsoring, the market (app) owner can pay these insignificant fees for the users, and he/she should not carry about this.

#### Free form collections 
The possibility to set any properties and put any values in them. 

#### Collections with adjusted permissions 
You can manage the white list and admin list for collections. Also, you specify for each property who can manage or change it. 

#### EVM integration 
* Support for standard EVM smart-contracts with benefits of whitelisting and sponsoring

* Native collections - ERC721Metadata (with ERC721Metadata support)
  * presented as contracts (ERC721-like) and may be interacted via Ethereum clients (like Metamask) and other smart contracts
* Possibility to create collections without smart contract deployment
* Admins - opportunity to assign and revoke up to 5 collection Administrators in any moment
* Seamless interop between Substrate and Ethereum API 
  * possibility to create and manage collection from the Substrate API and interact via Ethereum API and vice versa
* Nesting - examples, description.
* RFT. ERC20 and ERC1633-compatible. Specifics, description.  
* Ready-to-use solidity interfaces that are emulated.

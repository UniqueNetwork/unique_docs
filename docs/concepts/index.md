#### NFT 

#### RFT (fractional tokens)

The Fractional tokens provide a way for many users to own a part of an NFT. It democratizes premium digital assets through shared ownership powered by Re-Fungibile Token technology.

#### Nesting 
An NFT can contain another NFT or RFT inside. Also, you can create a bundle that contains NFT + RFT + USDT. When you send the parent NFT to someone, he/she will receive the entire bundle just in one transaction.

#### Transaction sponsoring

Usually, an end-user have to pay a transaction fees when creating a collection, selling or purchasing NFTs. But, where he should get a native currency of network for this.

We, in Unique Network, solves this issue. Using sponsoring, the market (app) owner can pay these insignificant fees for the users, and he/she should not carry about this.

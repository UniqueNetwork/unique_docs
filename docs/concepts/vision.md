# Our vision of NFT

While there are already tens of thousands of tokens created using blockchain, and thousands of them actively used (or traded), Non-Fungible Tokens are still in their infancy. We believe this will change.

## The Unique Network team considers the following use cases as main ones:

* Gaming – we see most activity in the NFT space in game items.
* Art – there are already experiments with digital art on blockchain, and it is matter of time until it sees wide adoption. When Web 3.0 becomes a reality, all digital files that we see on the internet will be NFT.
* Government – identity cards, real estate registers, vehicle registration - all of this is unique and will be digitally presented as an NFT as soon as the infrastructure becomes reliable and efficient enough to replace existing systems.
* Certificates – educational or any other certificates also need a unique digital representation.

While Ethereum network is still favoured by NFT creators, other blockchains get traction, as well. We will get a lot of good implementations that are stuck in their ecosystem in near future. Interoperability is in its very early phases.

Web3.0 is required to make the above-mentioned use cases real. Web 3.0 is powerful, interoperable, scalable solution that provides flexible economic models. Ethereum will not be the NFT platform world-wide, because of its strict economic system – each transaction requires gas fees, and we cannot imagine this approach will be used by anyone.

These are reasons why we decided to create NFT infrastructure and our chain using Substrate to be deployed on Kusama and Polkadot.

## The main components

1. Infrastructure:
* NFT Module;
* Smart contract module;
* Wallet and widgets for other wallets;
* Parachain.
2. Interoperability:
* NFT Bridges to other chains (or NFT components of existing bridges);
* Unity API (and other APIs).
3. NFT SDK and Solutions:
* Exchange;
* Gaming platforms;
* Identity;
* Certification;
* Software Licenses.

# Nested NFTs

## What are Nested NFTs?
Nested NFTs are NFT format that allows one NFT to own other NFTs. This nesting mechanism enables the creation of unique and complex hierarchies of digital assets within a single token, turning it into a multi-dimensional, multi-layered entity.

## Why are Nested NFTs unique?
- No Smart Contracts Required – Create and manage nested structures without the need for complex smart contract development.
- Hierarchical Structures – Nested NFTs allow for the embedding or linking of one NFT within another, creating rich, hierarchical digital asset structures..
- Simplified Management – Manage a multitude of assets via a single token, simplifying the portfolio and transaction processes.

## Use cases
- Digital Storytelling – Authors could nest chapters or scenes within a complete book or movie NFT.
- Complex Collectibles – Create sets of collectibles where specific NFTs belong to a larger set.
- Art Installations – Represent physical art installations as a primary NFT, with individual pieces as nested NFTs.

## Monetization ideas
- Exclusive Bundles – Sell Nested NFTs as exclusive, limited edition bundles of related items.
- Unlockable Content – Initial NFT could provide access to additional, nested content that becomes available over time or based on certain conditions.
- Portfolio Sales – Artists could sell a portfolio of their work as a single Nested NFT, creating a new way to distribute and monetize art collections.

## How can Nested NFTs benefit your users?
- Enhanced Interactivity – enables unique interactions between nested elements, offering users a rich and engaging experience.
- Increased Value – the ability to nest NFTs could create new value dynamics, as certain combinations of nested assets might become highly sought after.

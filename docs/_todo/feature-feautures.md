<!-- ### USDT on Unique
TODO mention USDT when it will be there

Unique Network provides native USDT support via XCM.

Today, IDEX is the most advanced exchange on Ethereum. By deploying to Moonbeam, IDEX is able to include assets from Polkadot and its parachains in their exchange without making major changes to their existing code. Moonbeam's interoperability with other parachains will help bridge IDEX to the many projects (and their tokens) coming to Polkadot. -->

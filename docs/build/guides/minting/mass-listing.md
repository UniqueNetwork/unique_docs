# Mass listing on Unique Market

These scripts are for those who already minted an extensive NFT collection and want to list a lot of tokens on the [Unique Market](https://unqnft.io). It can help you put NFTs up for sale quickly without manually signing every transaction.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step-1: Setting up environment

1. You will need node.js, git, and Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. If you haven't worked with git, node, and npm before, we recommend reading our [brief guide](./setup-environment.md) to configure your environment.
2. Download [this](https://github.com/UniqueNetwork/mass-selling/tree/master) project and open it in Visual Studio Code, click `File` - `Open Folder...`
3. Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and copy the contents from the `.env.example` file into it.
4. In the .env set `SUBSTRATE_SEED` with a 12-words mnemonic secret phrase of the NFTs owner. Set `COLLECTION_ID` with the id of your collection. Remember to save the file!
5. Install dependencies. Open VS Code built-in terminal by clicking `Terminal` - `New Terminal`. In the terminal window that appears, enter the command:

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm install
```

> ‚ùóÔ∏è Keep your secrets, such as SUBSTRATE_SEED, safe, and do not commit them to version control! We have added .env to the .gitignore file for this purpose.

In this step, your project should resemble the screenshot below:

## üìÑ Step-2: Get your NFTs list

Create a .csv file with a list of tokens that belong to you. Run in terminal:

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm run sub-build
```

After executing the script, the `collection_123.csv` file will be created in the root of the project with the contents:

| token id | price |
|----------|-------|
| 1        | 1     |
| 2        | 1     |
| 3        | 1     |

All your tokens from the specified collection are registered in the table. All tokens have a default price of 1. Change these prices to your liking and save the file.
Prices are expected to be written without decimals, so 1 in the price cell means 1 000 000 000 000 000 000 in a contract.

Set the desired price for the tokens you want to list on Unique Market and remove all the tokens you don't want to sell.

We set tokens 1, 2, 9, and 10 for sale here. Tokens 1 and 2 will be listed for 300 UNQ. Tokens 9 and 10 for 500 UNQ

## üéÅ Step-3: List your NFTs for sale

To put up for sale all the tokens in the created .csv file for the price specified in the file, run the script:

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm run sub-sell
```

It will take some time, and in the end, you will see your tokens listed for sale on Unique Market.

## Delist

To remove all the tokens from the created .csv file from the sale, run the script

```sh:no-line-numbers
npm run sub-delist
```

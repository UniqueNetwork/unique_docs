# Collections

[[toc]]

## Intro

NFTs have become much easier to issue, and we're seeing increasing amounts minted daily, mainly through NFT collections. This article will dive into NFT collection minting and some popular examples of how to work with NFT collections in Unique Network.

As the name implies, an NFT collection is a unique collection of NFTs. NFT artworks are generally created on a smaller scale with the involvement of concerned content creators or digital artists. In addition, you would also notice that individual NFT artworks are available for sale on different NFT marketplaces.

In Unique Network, the collection has the following entities:

- **name** - a collection name that defines it in the global scope;
- **description** - some additional details about the collection;
- **token prefix** - short string value that will be added to token IDs.
- **properties** - a unique set of keys and values which defines collection specifics;
- **limits** - a set that defines the rules for a collection, e.g., whether it can be transferred or how many tokens you can mint in it;
- **owner** - an address that created a collection (or if the collection was transferred, the address that owns the collection at the moment);
- **admins** - a collection can be controlled by multiple admin addresses. Admins can issue and burn NFTs, as well as add and remove other admins, but they cannot change NFT or collection ownership;

## Prerequisite

Follow the [Getting started guide](./quick-start.md) to install required libraries, receive test network OPL tokens, and initialize SDK.

## Creating a collection

Below is an (almost) minimum example. Only collection `name`, `description`, and `symbol` are mandatory fields. They exist at the collection level and cannot be overridden.

Collection coverage is a part of collection metadata and is not a mandatory field.

```ts:no-line-numbers
const collectionTx = await sdk.collection.create({
 name: "Test",
 description: "Test collection",
 symbol: "TST",
 info: {cover_image: {url: 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTkhTg5S5zrqJL3UsKtyiFi8fcMT3Cao9uKtadp3Ckh7m'}},
});

console.log("Collection ID:", collectionTx.result.collectionId);
```

In Unique Network every collection has a unique collection ID. You will need it later to [mint NFTs](./tokens.md).

You can check your collection successfully created on [Unique Scan](https://uniquescan.io/opal/collections/).

## Collection modes

There are three different collection modes in Unique Network:

- **NFT (default)** - Non-Fungible Tokens are unique digital assets with distinct properties and metadata. Each token is one-of-a-kind and cannot be replaced with another token.
- **Fungible** - Fungible tokens are identical and interchangeable, like traditional currencies. Each token has the same value and properties as any other token in the collection.
- **ReFungible** - Re-Fungible Tokens allow fractional ownership by dividing a single NFT into multiple fungible shares, enabling multiple people to own portions of the same unique asset.

You can specify the mode of collection during minting.

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.collection.create({
  name: "Test",
  description: "Test collection",
  symbol: "TST",
  info: {cover_image: {url: coverImage}},
  mode: 'Fungible' // <--- set collection mode here
});
```

## Collection properties

<!-- TODO 64 properties, is this correct? -->

Every collection in Unique Network can have up to 64 propertiesâ€”a unique set of keys and values that define collection specifics. Some of them relate to NFT metadata and are set automatically by SDK.

### Setting collection properties

During the collection creation, you can set collection properties as follows:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const {result} = await sdk.collection.create({
  name: "Test",
  description: "Test collection",
  symbol: "TST",
  info: {cover_image: {url: "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTkhTg5S5zrqJL3UsKtyiFi8fcMT3Cao9uKtadp3Ckh7m"}},
  properties: [ //  <--- set collection properties here
    {key: "A", value: "value A"},
    {key: "B", value: "value B"},
  ]
});
```

Later you can set new properties or modify previously created ones.

```ts:no-line-numbers
...

await sdk.collection.setProperties({
  collectionId: result.collectionId,
  properties: [{key: "C", value: "value C"}]
});
```

### Now, let's query our collection and check its properties

```ts:no-line-numbers
const collection = await sdk.collection.get({collectionId: result.collectionId});

console.log(collection.properties);
```

The result will be as follows, let's break it down.

```ts:no-line-numbers
[
  {
    key: "A",
    value: "value A",
    valueHex: "0x76616c75652041",
  },
  {
    key: "B",
    value: "value B",
    valueHex: "0x76616c75652042",
  },
  {
    key: "C",
    value: "value C",
    valueHex: "0x76616c75652043",
  },
  {
    key: "collectionInfo",
    value: "{\"schemaName\":\"unique\",\"schemaVersion\":\"2.0.0\",\"cover_image\":{\"url\":\"https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTkhTg5S5zrqJL3UsKtyiFi8fcMT3Cao9uKtadp3Ckh7m\"}}",
    valueHex: "0x7b22736368656d614e616d65223a22756e69717565222c22736368656d6156657273696f6e223a22322e302e30222c22636f7665725f696d616765223a7b2275726c223a2268747470733a2f2f676174657761792e70696e6174612e636c6f75642f697066732f516d546b6854673553357a72714a4c3355734b74796946693866634d543343616f39754b7461647033436b68376d227d7d",
  },
  {
    key: "schemaName",
    value: "unique",
    valueHex: "0x756e69717565",
  },
  {
    key: "schemaVersion",
    value: "2.0.0",
    valueHex: "0x322e302e30",
  },
]
```

- Properties `A`, `B`, and `C` has been manually set during the collection creation and modifying collection with `setCollectionLimits`
- The SDK sets' properties `schemaName`, `schemaVersion`, and `collectionInfo` and relate to the Unique metadata. You can read more about [Unique Metadata Format](../../../reference/schemas/index.md) in the reference section.

## Token property permissions

Every NFT token inside the collection can have properties. The list of allowed properties and their mutability permissions are handled on the collection level.

Let's look at how to specify them.

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.collection.create({
  name: "Test",
  description: "Test collection",
  symbol: "TST",
  info: {cover_image: {url: coverImage}},
  tokenPropertyPermissions: [ // <--- set token property permissions here
    {key: 'A', permission: {mutable: true, collectionAdmin: true, tokenOwner: true}},
    {key: 'B', permission: {mutable: false, collectionAdmin: false, tokenOwner: false}},
    {key: 'C', permission: {mutable: false, collectionAdmin: false, tokenOwner: true}},
  ]
});
```

Every NFT token in the collection above could have three properties:

- `A`: this property is mutable; it could be set during the NFT minting. Later, it could be rewritten by the collection admin or NFT owner
- `B`: this property is immutable and can be set only once during the minting
- `C`: this property is immutable and can be set only once during the minting or later by the token owner

The SDK also specifies some additional token properties related to Unique Metadata Format. Let's check them.

```ts:no-line-numbers
const collection = await sdk.collection.get({collectionId})

console.log(collection.tokenPropertyPermissions);
```

There are a lot of additional token properties, like `URI`, `customizing_overrides`, and so on. You can check more information about them in the [reference section](../../../reference/schemas/index.md).

One of the most important token properties is `tokenData`, which will be a container for all token attributes. You will learn more about `attributes` in the [NFT section](./tokens.md).

## Nesting configuration

In Unique Network, tokens can own other tokens through a mechanism known as nesting. Nesting permissions must be configured at the collection level to enable tokens within a collection to serve as parent tokens. Additionally, it is possible to limit which collections are allowed to participate in nesting and define the roles that can execute this action. Let's explore an example of how nesting can be set on a collection level.

```ts:no-line-numbers
const { result } = await sdk.collection.create({
  name: "Name",
  description: "Description",
  symbol: "SYM",
  permissions: { // <--- set nesting in the permissions section
  nesting: {
      collectionAdmin: true,
      tokenOwner: true,
      restricted: [1, 2],  // <--- restrict nesting for specific collections
    },
  },
});
```

## Collection limits

It is possible to set some limitations, such as:

- maximum number of tokens in the collection or
- how many tokens a single account can hold
- whether the token can be transferred or not
- and many more

You can read more about collection limits in the [reference section](../../../reference/blockchain/collections.md#limits).

And that is how you can set such limits:

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.collection.create({
  name: "Test",
  description: "Test collection",
  symbol: "TST",
  limits: { // <--- set collection limits here
    accountTokenOwnershipLimit: 1,
    ownerCanDestroy: true,
    ownerCanTransfer: false,
    sponsorApproveTimeout: 100,
    sponsoredDataRateLimit: 100,
    sponsoredDataSize: 2048,
    sponsorTransferTimeout: 10,
    tokenLimit: 300,
    transfersEnabled: false
  },
});
```

## Sponsoring

In Unique Network, transactions with collections can be sponsored, allowing for a gasless experience where the sponsor covers the transaction fees. This enables seamless and cost-free transfers of NFTs and the execution of smart contracts, even for accounts without native tokens.

Setting sponsorship of a collection should be done in several steps.

### Setting collection sponsor

Firstly, we need to specify an account that will pay transaction fees.

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.collection.setSponsor({ collectionId, sponsor: alice.address });
```

Secondly, the specified account should confirm sponsorship

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.collection.confirmSponsorship({ collectionId });
```

Finally, set sponsoring rate limits

```ts:no-line-numbers
  await sdk.collection.setLimits({
    collectionId,
    limits: {
      sponsorApproveTimeout: 0,
      sponsorTransferTimeout: 0,
    },
  });
```

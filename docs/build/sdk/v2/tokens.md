# NFTs

[[toc]]

## Intro

An NFT, or non-fungible token, represents a unique digital asset that cannot be replaced or exchanged on a one-to-one basis. NFTs can take many forms, such as JPEG images, music, or digital artwork. For example, as an artist, you could create a 3-minute YouTube video by combining your images and music. Once created, you can sell this video as an NFT, potentially at a great price if it offers value to the community. It's similar to purchasing art at a gallery, but it's a much simpler and more accessible process.

## Prerequisite

Follow the [Getting started guide](./quick-start.md) to install required libraries, receive test network UNQ tokens, and initialize SDK.

At this point, you need to know how to manage collections. Learn how to do this in the [Working with collections](./collections.md) guide.

## Getting started

Let's start with a minimum example. At this point, we assume you already minted your NFT collection, and you have its `collectionId`.

```ts:no-line-numbers
const mintNftTx = await unique.token.mintNFTs({
  collectionId,
  tokens: [
    {data: {image: 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTkhTg5S5zrqJL3UsKtyiFi8fcMT3Cao9uKtadp3Ckh7m'}},
    {data: {image: 'https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmQRUMbyfvioTcYiJYorEK6vNT3iN4pM6Sci9A2gQBuwuA'}},
  ]
});

const [nft1, nft2] = mintNftTx.result;

console.log('Minted tokens:', nft1.tokenId, nft2.tokenId);
```

Check your newly created tokens on [Unique Scan](https://uniquescan.io/opal/tokens/nfts)

## Querying tokens

### Get token by ID

Retrieve detailed information about a specific token:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const token = await unique.token.get({
  collectionId: 1,
  tokenId: 1
});

console.log(token);
```

The response includes:

```ts:no-line-numbers
{
  collectionId: 1,
  collectionAddress: "0x...",     // Ethereum mirror address of collection
  tokenId: 1,
  owner: "5GrwvaEF...",           // Direct owner (could be another token)
  topmostOwner: "5GrwvaEF...",    // Real account owner (top of nesting hierarchy)
  symbol: "COL",
  properties: [...],
  schemaName: "unique",
  schemaVersion: "2.0.0",
  image: "https://...",
  attributes: [...],
  decodingError: null
}
```

### Query with nested children

If the token has nested children, you can retrieve them in a single query:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const token = await unique.token.get({
  collectionId: 1,
  tokenId: 1,
  withChildren: true
});

if (token.children && token.children.length > 0) {
  console.log('This token owns', token.children.length, 'child tokens');
  token.children.forEach(child => {
    console.log(`Child: ${child.collectionId}:${child.tokenId}`);
  });
}
```

### Check possible actions

Before attempting an operation, you can check what actions are permitted for a token:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const actions = await unique.token.possibleActions({
  collectionId: 1,
  tokenId: 1,
  sender: account.address,
  transferTo: recipientAddress  // optional: check if transfer to specific address is possible
});

console.log(actions);
```

Returns:

```ts:no-line-numbers
{
  burn: true,                    // Can the sender burn this token?
  transfer: true,                // Can the sender transfer this token?
  nest: false,                   // Can the sender nest this token?
  unnest: false,                 // Can the sender unnest this token?
  changeProperties: ['A', 'B']   // Which properties can the sender modify?
}
```

This is useful for:

- Enabling/disabling UI buttons based on permissions
- Validating operations before submission
- Displaying user capabilities

Example usage:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const { burn, transfer } = await unique.token.possibleActions({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  sender: account.address
});

if (!transfer) {
  console.log('Transfer is not allowed for this token');
  return;
}

// Proceed with transfer
await unique.token.transfer({ collectionId, tokenId, to: recipient });
```

## Token properties and attributes

In the collections section, we've learned [basics about token properties](./collections.md#token-property-permissions). Let's do a quick recap.

1. Token property is a key/value pair
2. The list of possible keys, as well as their mutability, are set on the collection level

<!-- TODO intro about properties and attributes what is the difference -->

### Properties

Now, let's create a token and set its properties.

```ts:no-line-numbers
// This is an example of a collection created in the collection section
const {result} = await sdk.collection.create({
  name: "Test",
  description: "Test collection",
  symbol: "TST",
  info: {cover_image: {url: coverImage}},
  tokenPropertyPermissions: [ // <--- set token property permissions here
    {key: 'A', permission: {mutable: true, collectionAdmin: true, tokenOwner: true}},
    {key: 'B', permission: {mutable: false, collectionAdmin: false, tokenOwner: false}},
    {key: 'C', permission: {mutable: false, collectionAdmin: false, tokenOwner: true}},
  ]
});

const nftImage = "https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmTkhTg5S5zrqJL3UsKtyiFi8fcMT3Cao9uKtadp3Ckh7m";

const mintNftTx = await sdk.token.mintNFTs({
  collectionId: result.collectionId,
  tokens: [
    {data: {image: nftImage}, properties: [{key: "A", value: "value A"}]},
  ]
});
```

In the example above, we created only one NFT and set only one propertyâ€”`A`.

Later, the NFT owner can specify property `C`.

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.token.setProperties(
  {
    collectionId,
    tokenId: mintNftTx.result[0].tokenId,
    properties: [{key: "C", value: "value C"}]
  }
);
```

But because of permissions of property `B` it could have been set only during the minting. So it will remain unset forever.

### Attributes

Properties are a part of a token on a core blockchain level. They can be set with arbitrary metadata, i.e., schema name and version, royalties, etc.

Attributes define token traits and are not a part of a blockchain core. Examples of attributes could be a `power` or `experience` for a gaming character. In Unique Metadata, attributes are stored in `tokenData` property of an NFT.

Let's mint some extra tokens with attributes.

```ts:no-line-numbers
const mintNftTx = await sdk.token.mintNFTs({
 collectionId: result.collectionId,
 tokens: [
  {
    data: {
      image: nftImage,
      attributes: [ // <--- setting attributes
        {trait_type: "power", value: 50},
        {trait_type: "experience", value: 300}
      ]
    }
  },
 ]
});
```

Now, let's have a look at the newly created token.

```ts:no-line-numbers
const nft = await sdk.token.get({
 collectionId: result.collectionId,
 tokenId: 1
});

console.log(nft.attributes)
```

The output:

```ts:no-line-numbers
attributes: [
 { trait_type: 'power', value: 50 },
 { trait_type: 'experience', value: 300 }
],
```

And that is how your token will be displayed on [Unique Scan](https://uniquescan.io/opal/tokens) and other wallets.

### Properties and attributes mutation

In the collection section, we've learned that [token properties can be set as mutable](./collections.md#token-property-permissions) by the collection admin or token owner.

Let's make a quick recap of how it can be done. Below, we set mutability for token property `A`:

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.collection.create({
  ...
  tokenPropertyPermissions: [
    // This is how we specify token properties' mutability during the collection creation
    {key: 'A', permission: {mutable: true, collectionAdmin: true, tokenOwner: true}},

  ...
```

If the property is specified as mutable, it can be set after the token has been created.

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.token.setProperties({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  properties: [{ key: "A", value: "New value" }],
});
```

As far as deleted:

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.token.deleteProperties({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  keys: ['A'],
});
```

Attributes are part of `tokenData` property which is by default mutable for collection admin. You can override it during the collection creation.

The SDK provides the following method for attribute mutation:

```ts:no-line-numbers
await sdk.token.updateNft({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  data: {
    attributes: [
      {
        trait_type: "Power",
        value: 42,
      },
    ],
    image: "https://your-new-image.here/image.png",
  },
});
```

## Transfer

The token owner can transfer its token if the [collection limits](./collections.md#collection-limits) do not restrict token transfer.

```ts:no-line-numbers
await unique.token.transfer({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  to: "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY"
});
```

::: tip Collection admin privileges
If the collection was created with `ownerCanTransfer: true`, the collection owner and admins can transfer any token without approval using `transferFrom`.
:::

It is also possible to approve the transfer for another account.

```ts:no-line-numbers
// SDK's default account approves NFT for Alice
const approvalTx = await sdk.token.approve({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  spender: alice.address,
});

// Let's check token is approved
const { isApproved } = await sdk.token.getApproved({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  spender: alice.address,
});

// Now, Alice can transfer approved token
const transferFromTx = await sdk.token.transfer(
  {
    to: alice.address,
    collectionId,
    tokenId: token1.tokenId,
    from: account.address,
  },
  {
    signerAddress: alice.address,
  },
  // This transaction made by Alice
  alice,
);
```

## Burn

The token owner can destroy its token if the [collection limits](./collections.md#collection-limits) do not restrict token burn.

### Burn your own token

```ts:no-line-numbers
const result = await unique.token.burn({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
});

console.log('Burned token:', result.tokenId);
console.log('Amount burned:', result.amount);
```

### Burn from another account (with approval)

If a token is approved for an account, that account can burn the token without first transferring it:

```ts:no-line-numbers
// Step 1: Owner approves Alice to manage the token
await unique.token.approve({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  spender: alice.address,
});

// Step 2: Alice burns the token directly from owner's account
await unique.token.burnFrom(
  {
    collectionId,
    tokenId,
    from: owner.address,  // The token owner's address
    amount: 1             // Amount to burn (for fungible/refungible tokens)
  },
  { signerAddress: alice.address },  // Transaction signer
  alice                               // Account object with signer
);
```

::: tip Collection admin privileges
If the collection was created with `ownerCanTransfer: true`, the collection owner and admins can burn any token without approval using `burnFrom`.
:::

The `burnFrom` method is particularly useful for:

- **Marketplace operations**: Burn tokens when removing listings
- **Game mechanics**: Burn items from player inventories
- **Automated systems**: Allow smart contracts or services to burn approved tokens

::: tip
For NFTs, `amount` is always 1. For fungible and refungible tokens, you can specify the amount to burn.
:::

## Nesting

In Unique Network tokens can own other tokens through a mechanism called nesting. In the [collection section](./collections.md#nesting-configuration) you've learned how nesting can be configured on the collection level.

### Nesting tokens

Nest one token inside another:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const result = await unique.token.nest({
  parent: { collectionId, tokenId: parentTokenId },
  nested: { collectionId, tokenId: childTokenId }
});

console.log('Child token owner:', result.owner);      // Will be the parent token address
console.log('Topmost owner:', result.topmostOwner);  // Will be the real account owner
```

After nesting, the child token's ownership structure changes:

- **owner**: The parent token (represented as an address)
- **topmostOwner**: The real account that owns the parent token

### Understanding ownership hierarchy

When tokens are nested, there's a distinction between direct owner and topmost owner:

```ts:no-line-numbers
// Create a nesting hierarchy: Account â†’ Token A â†’ Token B
await unique.token.nest({
  parent: { collectionId, tokenId: tokenA },
  nested: { collectionId, tokenId: tokenB }
});

const tokenB = await unique.token.get({
  collectionId,
  tokenId: tokenB
});

console.log('Direct owner:', tokenB.owner);         // Token A's address
console.log('Topmost owner:', tokenB.topmostOwner); // Your account address
```

If you transfer Token A to another account, Token B's topmost owner automatically updates:

```ts:no-line-numbers
await unique.token.transfer({
  collectionId,
  tokenId: tokenA,
  to: newOwner.address
});

// Token B's topmostOwner is now newOwner.address
const updatedTokenB = await unique.token.get({ collectionId, tokenId: tokenB });
console.log('New topmost owner:', updatedTokenB.topmostOwner); // newOwner.address
```

### Querying nested structure

Get a token with all its nested children:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const parentToken = await unique.token.get({
  collectionId,
  tokenId: parentTokenId,
  withChildren: true
});

if (parentToken.children) {
  console.log(`Parent token owns ${parentToken.children.length} children:`);
  parentToken.children.forEach(child => {
    console.log(`- ${child.collectionId}:${child.tokenId}`);
  });
}
```

### Unnesting tokens

The topmost owner can unnest tokens, transferring them back to their account:

```ts:no-line-numbers
// Unnest to the topmost owner
await unique.token.unnest({
  nested: { collectionId, tokenId: childTokenId }
});
```

You can also unnest to a specific address:

```ts:no-line-numbers
// Unnest to a specific address
await unique.token.unnest({
  nested: { collectionId, tokenId: childTokenId },
  to: recipientAddress
});
```

### Burning nested tokens

::: warning Leaf node rule
Only leaf node tokens (tokens with no nested children) can be burned. To burn a parent token, you must first burn all its descendants in reverse nesting order.
:::

For example, if you have this nested structure:

```
Token A3 (root)
â”œâ”€â”€ Token A4
â”œâ”€â”€ Token A5
â””â”€â”€ Token B1
    â””â”€â”€ Token B2
```

To burn token A3, you should burn tokens in specific order, for example: B2 â†’ [B1, A4, A5] â†’ A3.

You can use the `withChildren` query option to check if a token has nested children before attempting to burn it:

```ts:no-line-numbers
const token = await unique.token.get({
  collectionId,
  tokenId,
  withChildren: true
});

if (token.children && token.children.length > 0) {
  console.log('Cannot burn: token has nested children');
  console.log('Must burn these children first:', token.children);
} else {
  // Safe to burn - this is a leaf node
  await unique.token.burn({ collectionId, tokenId });
}
```

### Nesting use cases

Nesting enables powerful composability patterns:

1. **Gaming**: Characters own equipment, vehicles own parts
2. **Collections**: Bundle related NFTs together
3. **Fractional ownership**: A bundle token owns multiple asset tokens
4. **Hierarchical assets**: Company â†’ Department â†’ Assets

:::tip Understanding token addresses

In Unique Network, every collection and token has a unique ID that can be mapped to an EVM address. Nesting is implemented as a transfer of the child token to the parent token's address.

The concept of collections and token addresses is particularly useful when working with [smart contracts](../../evm/index.md).
:::

:::info Technical note
Under the hood, nested tokens are automatically approved for `transferFrom` by the topmost owner. The `unnest` method is syntactic sugar - you can also transfer nested tokens directly using the regular `transfer` method. See [Transfer](#transfer) for details.
